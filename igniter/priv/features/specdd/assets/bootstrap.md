# SpecDD Bootstrap

You are working inside a SpecDD-governed project.

SpecDD is a framework for Spec-Driven Development.

The project is guided by small `.sdd` spec files that live near the files, directories, workflows, or contracts they
describe.

Specs are source-adjacent development contracts. Treat them as binding instructions, not optional documentation.

This bootstrap file defines the base operating rules for agents working in the project. It tells you how to find specs,
how to resolve inherited constraints, and how to determine what you may read or modify.

Also, read adjacent bootstrap files when they exist:

```text
.specdd/bootstrap.md
-> .specdd/bootstrap.project.md
-> .specdd/bootstrap.local.md
```

Use them in order:

- `bootstrap.md` defines the general SpecDD framework rules.
- `bootstrap.project.md` defines project-specific rules and overrides.
- `bootstrap.local.md` defines local operator or environment preferences.

Later files override earlier files when they are stricter or more specific. Local overrides must not silently weaken
project contracts, inherited constraints, ownership, or modification permission.

Before editing any target, identify:

- The requested target path or task.
- The applicable bootstrap files.
- The effective spec chain.
- Whether each `.sdd` target was selected for change by the Operator's request, an active SpecDD workflow, or an
  authorized task.
- For each non-`.sdd` project artifact, its authoritative owning spec and the modification scope granted by the active
  spec.

If you cannot identify ownership or modification permission for a non-`.sdd` project artifact, stop and ask the
Operator.

## Execution Contract

For implementation work, follow this loop:

```text
Resolve -> Read -> Authorize -> Change -> Verify -> Report
```

Do not skip directly to `Change`.

- `Resolve`: identify the target path or task and the applicable bootstrap/spec chain.
- `Read`: read the bootstrap files, inherited specs, and relevant explicit `References`.
- `Authorize`: confirm each `.sdd` or bootstrap control-file target is editable under the Spec Edit Authority rules; for
  every non-`.sdd` project artifact, confirm the modification scope and resolve its authoritative owning spec.
- `Change`: make the smallest correct change inside that authority.
- `Verify`: run relevant checks when available, or explain why they were not run.
- `Report`: summarize specs used, files changed, verification, and any remaining uncertainty.

## Operating Rules

When making changes:

- Resolve the relevant SpecDD spec chain.
- Follow inherited constraints.
- Work only within local authority.
- Implement the smallest correct change.
- Keep changed files, artifacts, checks, tasks, specs, and other relevant assets aligned.

If any instruction conflicts with your default coding habits or assumptions, follow SpecDD. Do not treat examples,
conventions, nearby files, or familiar project patterns as permission to ignore the active spec chain.

If the Operator asks you to create or modify specs, follow the Spec Edit Authority rules below and do not alter
implementation files or operational artifacts unless explicitly asked.

If unclear requirements affect scope, ownership, modification permission, destructive changes, security, or public
behavior, ask the Operator before editing. For minor ambiguity, choose the option that best preserves inherited
constraints and local scope.

Stop and ask the Operator before editing when:

- No applicable spec exists for a non-`.sdd` project artifact.
- Ownership or modification permission is unclear for a non-`.sdd` project artifact.
- The requested work cannot be completed without violating `Must not` or `Forbids`.
- A non-`.sdd` project-artifact change would touch files outside the modification scope granted by `Owns` plus
  `Can modify`.
- Requirements affect security, destructive behavior, or public contracts and are ambiguous.

## Planning Mode

If the Operator asks for a plan, do not edit files.

Instead:

- Resolve the relevant bootstrap files and spec chain.
- Summarize the target scope.
- Identify specs or files that would need changes.
- Call out unclear requirements, conflicts, and risks.
- Propose the smallest safe sequence of changes.
- Wait for the Operator to approve or revise the plan.

Use planning mode especially when the request is to apply framework or spec changes.

## Core Model

SpecDD projects are developed top-down. Operators define structure, boundaries, behavior, implementation tasks, and
other work through local specs. Agents perform that work locally within those boundaries.

A spec should include only sections that add useful local authority, constraints, behavior, or context. Do not repeat
parent rules unless narrowing or clarifying them.

A spec describes the durable subject and the outcomes, invariants, boundaries, and behavior that must hold for that
subject. It is not a work order, migration note, adoption plan, ticket, prompt, or task contract.

When a task causes a spec to be created or changed, the spec should still describe the resulting subject contract, not
the task that produced it.

A local spec should stay relevant to the subject's real boundary. It should not list everything the subject obviously
does not do. Negative rules are useful only when they prevent plausible boundary mistakes, dependency inversions,
security or data risks, or repeated local confusion.

Specs are local maps, not inventories. A directory spec describes the directory concept and the roles of immediate
children. It should not describe nested descendant inventory or detailed behavior for a file, class, service, job,
adapter, artifact, component, workflow, operation, interface, policy, or asset when a nearer spec can own that detail.

When a same-directory artifact or other subject, such as a file, class, service, component, job, adapter, workflow,
operation, interface, policy, or asset, has substantial behavior, put that behavior in a same-basename spec next to the
subject. Keep the directory spec focused on the local boundary and immediate structure.

Avoid both overreach and overcorrection: do not pull child-specific details into parent specs, and do not replace useful
immediate roles with vague labels.

The following questions are prompts, not a checklist. Answer only those that have a material local answer; do not create
a section merely because a prompt or section label exists.

A useful spec answers the relevant local questions:

- What stable outcome or responsibility does this subject provide?
- What does it own?
- What may be modified?
- What may be read?
- What outcomes, invariants, or behaviors must hold?
- What nearby boundaries, non-goals, or forbidden behavior might otherwise be confused with this subject?
- What may it depend on?
- What behavior or examples matter?
- What local tasks remain to satisfy the subject contract?
- What completion criteria show that the subject contract holds?

Good specs are:

- Local.
- Specific.
- Short.
- Behavioral.
- Constraint-oriented.
- Easy for humans to review.
- Easy for agents to follow.

### Relevance Gate

Every section and entry must earn its place in the local contract. Keep an entry only when removing it would materially
change a reasonable implementation, review, or verification decision or remove necessary local context about the
subject. Relevant entries grant local authority, define observable behavior or invariants, establish a plausible
dependency or boundary, provide necessary local context, or make the local contract verifiable. Omit entries that
merely state common sense, repeat implied defaults, or describe capabilities unrelated to the subject.

Evaluate a negative entry against the effective spec with that candidate entry removed. Keep it only when a reasonable
implementer could then choose the forbidden behavior and it would be a plausible local mistake. Crossing the subject's
boundary or misusing a dependency may be exactly the mistake the entry needs to prevent. Omit the entry when the
behavior is unrelated, implausible, or already excluded by another active rule.

Apply this gate to entries being added or materially edited. Do not opportunistically remove untouched legacy entries
during a scoped change; report them unless the Operator requested a full-spec review or cleanup.

## Spec Files

Spec files use a line-oriented, section-based format and the `.sdd` extension.

The root project spec must live at the selected content root and must be named after the basename of that root directory.

Example:

```text
/home/alex/Projects/travel-planner/ -> /home/alex/Projects/travel-planner/travel-planner.sdd
```

Human-facing names and technical identifiers do not override this rule. For example, a project described as
`Travel Planner` with identifiers such as `TravelPlanner` still uses `travel-planner/travel-planner.sdd` when the
content root directory is named `travel-planner`.

Common non-root spec names include:

```text
module.sdd
feature.sdd
service.sdd
model.sdd
adapter.sdd
api.sdd
component.sdd
job.sdd
event.sdd
policy.sdd
workflow.sdd
operation.sdd
interface.sdd
dataset.sdd
schema.sdd
runbook.sdd
```

These names are examples, not universal requirements. Projects may use different names and levels for infrastructure,
automation, documentation, operations, data, policy, or mixed repositories.

Named specs are allowed when multiple specs exist in one directory and unsuffixed names would collide or be ambiguous.
When in doubt, omit the suffix.

Same-directory basename matching is an explicit SpecDD rule. When a target file and a `.sdd` file live in the same
directory and share the same basename, the `.sdd` file is the matching local spec for that target file.
Same-basename matching is case-insensitive. Prefer an exact filename match when present. If multiple case-insensitive
matches exist and no exact match exists, report ambiguity instead of guessing.

Examples:

```text
itinerary.js -> itinerary.sdd
trip-storage.js -> trip-storage.sdd
itinerary.test.js -> itinerary.test.sdd
travel-planner.config.js -> travel-planner.config.sdd
```

This is not a guess. It is part of spec resolution. Similar names in other directories, symbols inside files, module
names, or test names do not create a spec relationship by themselves.

Align the names of other specs and source or artifact files when a project convention exists, but conventions beyond
same-directory basename matching do not define inheritance, governing scope, ownership, or modification permission by
themselves.

When no project naming convention applies, prefer this order:

- Follow existing project conventions.
- If the folder already describes the thing, do not suffix.
- If the folder does not describe the thing, use a descriptive suffix.

Examples:

```text
itinerary.sdd
trip-storage.sdd
destination-search.adapter.sdd
```

## Common Spec Roles

Spec names and roles are project conventions, not framework requirements, except for the root project spec basename
rule. Common roles include:

- root project spec: global application, repository, or project context.
- `module.sdd`: bounded domain, subsystem, package, role, stack, or area.
- `feature.sdd`: user-visible, operational, or business capability.
- `service.sdd`: orchestration or application/domain behavior.
- `model.sdd`: domain state, data shape, entity, value object, or invariant.
- `adapter.sdd`: boundary implementation for an external system.
- `api.sdd`: inbound interface such as HTTP, GraphQL, RPC, CLI, or webhook.
- `component.sdd`: UI or reusable component behavior.
- `job.sdd`: background, scheduled, or automated work.
- `event.sdd`: emitted or consumed event/message contract.
- `policy.sdd`: authorization, permission, or decision rules.
- `workflow.sdd`: operational sequence, procedure, or coordinated work.
- `operation.sdd`: repeatable action, command, intervention, or process step.
- `interface.sdd`: boundary surface between people, systems, tools, or components.
- `dataset.sdd`: data collection, feed, table, index, or analytical source.
- `runbook.sdd`: operational procedure, recovery path, or maintenance instruction.

## Path-Based Resolution

Spec inheritance is implicit and directory-based.

Path-based resolution is the core SpecDD invariant. Applicable specs come from ancestor specs, directory-level specs,
explicit `References`, and same-directory basename matches. Do not infer the applicable spec, ownership, or write
authority from similar names in other directories, symbols, programming languages, module names, test names, or
tool-specific conventions unless a project-specific spec or configuration explicitly defines that mapping.

When working on a target path, start at that target and walk upward to the selected content root.
There can be multiple spec hierarchies in a project; only the target path's ancestor tree is relevant.

Resolution algorithm:

- Classify the target as a directory, a `.sdd` spec file, or an ordinary file.
- A target selected for creation need not exist. Resolve it from its normalized intended path and existing ancestor
  directories.
- If the target is an existing `.sdd` file, treat that file as the target spec and do not resolve `Owns` or `Can modify`
  authority for the file itself.
- If a new `.sdd` file is selected for creation, resolve the bootstrap files and the intended directory's ancestry
  without requiring the target to exist or appear in `Owns` or `Can modify`.
- If the target is an existing or intended ordinary file, include the same-directory same-basename `.sdd` spec when it
  exists.
- If an ordinary file has no same-basename spec, continue resolving upward from its intended parent directory.
- Before creating an ordinary file, require its normalized intended path to be covered by the pre-operation `Owns` or
  `Can modify` authority defined below, unless it is a bootstrap override authorized under the Spec Edit Authority
  rules.
- Walk upward through parent directories until the selected content root.
- At each directory, collect specs whose declared governing scope applies to the target.
- Reverse the collected inherited specs so they are read from root to target.
- Include explicit `References` declared by the included specs when they affect the task or are needed to build context.

Directory-level specs are specs whose basename matches the directory they govern. Matching is case-insensitive, but exact
basename matches win. If multiple case-insensitive matches exist for the same placement and no exact match exists, report
ambiguity.

For a directory path, two directory-level spec placements are recognized:

- Parent-held: a spec in the parent directory with the same basename as the governed child directory, such as
  `src/trips.sdd` for `src/trips/`.
- Local: a spec inside the governed directory with the same basename as that directory, such as `src/trips/trips.sdd`
  for `src/trips/`.

Use parent-held specs only when the governed child path exists as a directory. Parent-held and local specs for the same
directory are cumulative context, not ambiguity. When both exist, order parent-held context before local context for that
directory.

The same basename rule applies at the selected content root. A content root whose basename is `travel-planner` must use
`travel-planner.sdd` as its root project spec. This is the root directory context spec, not new `.sdd` syntax.

Resolve vertical directory context from the selected content root down to the target directory using the directory-level
rules above. A tool that scans a directory target may also include specs recursively under that target according to that
tool's command semantics.

A spec's governing scope should be discoverable from the spec itself. Relevant signals include:

- `Owns` or `Structure` entries that cover the target path.
- Same-directory basename matching.
- Directory-level basename matching.
- A clear directory-scope role, such as an app, module, feature, or service spec governing that directory subtree.
- A project-specific rule that explicitly defines the mapping.

`Can modify` establishes non-owning edit permission only. It may make a spec relevant to a task, but it does not show
that the spec governs or owns the target.

If a spec's scope is not discoverable, do not guess from similar names. Use the nearest applicable parent spec and ask
the Operator when ownership or modification permission is unclear.

Example for `src/trips/itinerary.js`:

```text
travel-planner/
  travel-planner.sdd
  src/
    trips/
      trips.sdd
      itinerary.sdd
      itinerary.js
      itinerary.test.js
      trip-storage.sdd
      trip-storage.js
      trip-storage.test.js
    destinations/
      destinations.sdd
      destination-search.sdd
      destination-search.js
    ui/
      itinerary-view.sdd
      itinerary-view.js
```

Parent specs provide inherited context and constraints. Child specs add or narrow context and constraints.

Core rule:

```text
Vertical inheritance is implicit.
Other context references are explicit.
```

Do not automatically load sibling specs. Use sibling or cross-tree specs only when the local spec explicitly references
them, or when directly necessary to understand the active contract.

Do not infer context from symbols or nearby files. Use path inheritance, same-directory basename matching, and explicit
`References`. Nearby files are optional context, not authority.

## Constraint Inheritance

Parent constraints remain active in child specs.

A child spec may:

- Add more specific rules.
- Narrow allowed behavior.
- Add local responsibilities.
- Add local tasks.
- Define local behavior.

A child spec must not silently:

- Loosen parent constraints.
- Ignore parent `Must not` rules.
- Use parent-forbidden dependencies.
- Expand modification scope beyond local authority.
- Contradict inherited architecture.

If compatible local and parent constraints differ in strictness, apply the stricter interpretation. If one requires
what another forbids, treat them as an unresolved conflict under Conflict Handling rather than choosing either rule.

## Write Authority

### Spec Edit Authority

`.sdd` files are framework contracts, not owned project artifacts. A spec selected as a change target is implicitly
modifiable and requires no `Owns` or `Can modify` entry in any spec, including the target spec itself. `Owns` and
`Can modify` never grant or restrict modification permission for `.sdd` files, whether matched directly, through a
directory, or by a glob.

Implicit modifiability removes only the path-authorization check. It does not select inherited, referenced, sibling, or
nearby specs for editing. Edit a spec only when the Operator's request, an active SpecDD workflow, or an authorized task
selects it. Continue to follow bootstrap rules and inherited constraints, and apply normal ownership and modification
rules to every non-`.sdd` project artifact.

`bootstrap.md` is immutable. `bootstrap.project.md` and `bootstrap.local.md` need no `Owns` or `Can modify` entry but may
be edited only at the Operator's explicit request or when another explicit instruction authorizes the edit.

Use `References`, not `Owns` or `Can modify`, when one spec names another spec as context.

### Non-Spec Write Authority

Ownership authority and modification permission are distinct.

Before the first change in an operation, snapshot the effective `Owns` and `Can modify` authority available to that
operation and evaluate every non-`.sdd` project artifact against it. Spec edits do not expand authority usable during
that operation unless the Operator explicitly requests both the authority change and the corresponding non-spec
change. Authority reductions apply immediately.

By default:

- `Owns` identifies the spec that is authoritative for an item's contract. Every owned path is implicitly modifiable
  and readable under that spec; `Owns` already includes the permission represented by `Can modify`.
- `Can modify` grants only additional, non-owning permission to edit paths the spec does not own. It does not transfer
  ownership, make the spec authoritative for those paths, or override their owning specs. Every such path is also
  readable.
- The modification boundary is the union of owned paths and the additional paths in `Can modify`. A path in `Owns` must
  not also appear in `Can modify`; the duplicate grants no additional permission and must be omitted.
- Before modifying a path through `Can modify`, resolve and obey that path's owning spec and effective spec chain in
  addition to the active spec. If ownership is unclear or the contracts conflict, stop and ask the Operator.
- `References` and `Depends on` imply read access to their path entries and grant neither ownership nor modification
  permission. Use `Can read` only for additional read context not already represented by inherited context or another
  section.
- Spec proximity and behavioral relevance do not grant write authority. Modify a non-`.sdd` project artifact only when
  the pre-operation authority snapshot covers it through `Owns` or `Can modify`.
- Do not perform broad refactors unless the spec or Operator explicitly asks for them.
- If no local spec exists, use the nearest parent spec for behavior and context, but modify only the smallest necessary
  set of files covered by the authority snapshot.
- If no applicable spec can be found, ask the Operator to identify or create the relevant spec before making changes.

## Universal Spec Language

This section is authoritative for `.sdd` syntax. If examples, project prose, or conventions conflict with these rules,
these rules win. Project rules may add meaning to entries, but must not redefine syntax.

When creating or editing `.sdd` files, check the changed specs against this agent-facing syntax checklist before
reporting completion:

- A complete `.sdd` file starts with `Spec: Name`; only blank lines and comments may appear before it.
- Section labels are exact and case-sensitive. Unknown section labels are invalid in strict validation.
- Only `Spec`, `Platform`, `Scenario`, and `Example` may have inline values after `:`.
- `Spec`, `Platform`, and `Scenario` require nonempty inline values when present.
- `Spec` and `Platform` are bodyless.
- All known sections except `Scenario` and `Example` are non-repeatable.
- Repeated `Scenario` sections must have distinct trimmed titles.
- Body entries use exactly two spaces. Continuation lines use four or more spaces in multiples of two.
- `Tasks` accepts task lines only.
- Task markers are `[ ]`, `[x]`, `[X]`, `[-]`, `[!]`, and `[?]`.
- Explicit paths start with `./`, `../`, or `/`. Unprefixed filenames are ordinary text.
- `/` resolves from the selected content root.
- Key-value lines use `key: value` with one literal space after `:`.
- Inline trailing comments do not exist; text after other syntax is content.

### File And Line Rules

- A spec file uses the `.sdd` extension, is plain text, should be UTF-8, may use LF, CRLF, or CR line endings, and is
  line-oriented.
- `.sdd` is Markdown-adjacent, but it is not Markdown, YAML, TOML, JSON, or Gherkin.
- Each line is classified as blank, a comment, a section header, a body entry, a continuation, or invalid text.
- Line classification precedence is: comment, known section header, continuation, task line, scenario step, key-value,
  text.
- Comments, blank lines, and section headers may appear before the first section. Other top-level text is invalid.

### Indentation And Comments

- Non-comment indentation uses spaces only. Tabs are invalid.
- Non-comment indentation width must be a multiple of two spaces.
- Section headers start at column 0.
- Body entries use exactly two spaces.
- Continuations use four or more spaces, in multiples of two, and require a preceding body entry in the same section.
- Extracted continuation text is normalized by trimming each segment, dropping empty continuation segments, and joining
  remaining segments with one ASCII space.
- A comment line is any line whose first non-whitespace character is `#`.
- Comments are ignored as spec content and create no requirements, constraints, tasks, references, ownership, or
  modification permission.
- Inline trailing comments do not exist. Text after other syntax is ordinary content.

### Sections

Section headers use `KnownSectionLabel:` or `KnownSectionLabel: inline value`. Labels are case-sensitive. The colon must
immediately follow the label. Whitespace before the colon is invalid. If an inline value exists, at least one space must
follow the colon. Unknown section labels are invalid in strict validation.

Canonical labels and recommended order:

```text
Spec
Platform
Purpose
Structure
Owns
Can modify
Can read
References
Must
Must not
Forbids
Depends on
Exposes
Accepts
Returns
Raises
Handles
Tasks
Done when
Scenario
Example
```

Section rules:

- A complete `.sdd` file starts with `Spec`.
- Only `Spec`, `Platform`, `Scenario`, and `Example` may have inline values.
- `Spec`, `Platform` (when present), and `Scenario` require nonempty inline values.
- Empty or whitespace-only required inline values are invalid.
- `Example` may have an inline value, body entries, or both.
- `Spec` and `Platform` are bodyless.
- All known sections except `Scenario` and `Example` are non-repeatable.
- Repeated `Scenario` sections must have distinct trimmed titles.
- `Example` may repeat with or without titles.

### Body Entries

- `Tasks` accepts task lines only. Continuations may follow task lines.
- Body entries and continuations require a current section.
- All known sections except `Spec`, `Platform`, and `Tasks` are mixed-entry body sections.
- Mixed-entry sections may contain prose, explicit paths, globs, symbols, references, scenario steps, and key-value
  lines.
- Section names give entries their semantic role; path-bearing section names do not make the body path-only.
- Blank lines and comments are valid anywhere.

### Inline Code And Symbols

- Inline code spans use balanced single backticks on one line. They mark exact literal or code-formatted text and do not
  change section structure or body validity.
- Backticks do not suppress `@` symbol references. Recognize them inside inline code spans using the same rules as
  elsewhere; the start of span content is a valid symbol boundary. Explicit paths inside inline code spans remain
  literal and non-resolving.
- Symbol references start with `@` at the start of a line or inline code span, after whitespace, or after an opening
  punctuation character: `(`, `[`, `{`, `<`, `"`, or `'`.
- The first symbol character after `@` must be an ASCII letter or `_`.
- Later symbol characters may be ASCII letters, digits, `_`, `.`, `:`, `#`, `\`, `/`, `?`, or `!`.
- A symbol ends at the first character outside that set.
- If captured symbol text ends with `.`, and it is followed by whitespace, the end of the line, or one of the closing
  punctuation characters `)`, `]`, `}`, `>`, `"`, or `'`, the final `.` is sentence punctuation and is excluded.
- `\@` is literal text and must not be recognized as a symbol reference.
- Do not recognize `@` inside a larger non-whitespace token unless the immediately preceding character is an allowed
  opening punctuation character.
- When text identifies a code symbol or externally meaningful code contract, it must use an `@` symbol reference in
  every section and within prose. This includes classes, interfaces, methods, functions, types, constant identifiers,
  and exceptions. An unprefixed code name is ordinary text and must not be relied on as a symbol reference.
- Symbol references may appear inside or outside inline code spans. Backticks are not required for a symbol reference;
  use them only when the containing fragment would normally be written as inline code.
- Use inline code spans for exact literal values, including strings, booleans, numbers, null-like values, enum and wire
  values, field names, token formats, service names, namespaces, part numbers, configuration keys, path-like literals,
  arithmetic, and inline code expressions.
- Inline code spans are semantic notation, not emphasis. Do not backtick ordinary prose, descriptive phrases,
  human-facing labels, scenario narration, or entire entries. Backtick only the smallest exact literal, value, token,
  expression, or code fragment that would normally be written as inline code.
- Fence markers are ordinary body text in `.sdd`; fenced code blocks are not special `.sdd` syntax.

Example fragment:

```sdd
Must:
  The status becomes `active` after approval.
  Approved requests remain visible.

Exposes:
  @BillingClass.someMethod

Example:
  enabled: `true`
  retry count: `3`
  calculation: `subtotal + tax`
  invocation: `@BillingClass.someMethod(input)`
```

### Paths, Globs, And Key-Value Lines

- Explicit paths start with `./`, `../`, or `/`.
- `./` and `../` resolve relative to the directory containing the current `.sdd` file.
- `/` resolves relative to the selected content root.
- `~/` is unsupported.
- Prefer `./...` for local files and child paths.
- Use `../...` only for a path one parent level away when that keeps the reference clear.
- For paths more than one parent level away, prefer `/...` content-root paths in `Can read`, `References`, `Depends on`,
  and similar explicit path entries.
- Unprefixed prose, filenames, dependency names, class names, service names, symbols, and ordinary text are not explicit
  path references.
- Globs are explicit path candidates containing `*`, `?`, `[`, `]`, `{`, or `}`.
- Supported glob constructs are `*`, `?`, `[abc]`, `{a,b}`, `**`, and `**/`.
- Malformed glob patterns are valid text.
- Path-bearing sections are `Structure`, `Owns`, `Can modify`, `Can read`, `References`, `Depends on`, `Forbids`, and
  `Exposes`.
- A plain body entry beginning with `./`, `../`, or `/` is an explicit path candidate.
- A key-value line whose key begins with `./`, `../`, or `/` uses the key as the explicit path candidate.
- Inline paths in text are recognized only when they use `./`, `../`, or `/`. URLs are not file paths.
- A key-value line is `key: value`: first qualifying colon, nonempty key, no whitespace before the colon, one literal
  space after it, and any value including empty. Key case has no language meaning. `key:` is text.

### Section Meanings

- `Spec`: required first section for a complete file; names the subject; inline nonempty; no body.
- `Platform`: optional inherited technical platform, runtime, framework, or tool stack; inline nonempty; no body. It is
  not subject role, namespace, file type, or behavior prose.
- `Purpose`: stable outcome or responsibility the specified unit exists to provide; not the current task or change
  request.
- `Structure`: files, directories, and immediate project artifacts in current or descendant scope, described at the
  current spec's level of authority; not a deep inventory when child specs can own the detail.
- `Owns`: non-`.sdd` files, directories, symbols, concepts, or responsibilities for which the spec is the authoritative
  contract owner; ownership is exclusive, and every owned path is implicitly modifiable and readable under the spec;
  mixed entries.
- `Can modify`: additional non-`.sdd` files or paths that may be changed under the spec without being owned by it;
  permission implies read access but does not transfer authority or override the owning spec's constraints; mixed
  entries.
- `Can read`: additional files, paths, specs, or prose context that may be read when access is not already implied by
  inherited context or another section; mixed entries.
- `References`: explicit references to specs, files, symbols, contracts, or context; mixed entries. References may point
  anywhere explicit paths or symbols can resolve. Path references imply read access, grant neither ownership nor
  modification permission, and should preserve dependency direction.
- `Must`: required outcomes, invariants, and observable behavior; not implementation steps or work instructions.
- `Must not`: locally plausible forbidden behavior, adjacent non-goals, and boundaries needed to prevent likely misuse;
  not arbitrary capabilities, common-sense exclusions, or behavior unrelated to the subject.
- `Forbids`: disallowed dependencies, paths, modules, libraries, or architectural access that could otherwise be used
  in this subject; not an exhaustive list of unrelated things.
- `Depends on`: dependencies, collaborators, contracts, symbols, paths, or required context; path entries imply read
  access but grant neither ownership nor modification permission; mixed entries.
- `Exposes`: public entry points, exported symbols, APIs, contracts, interfaces, signals, surfaces, or observable
  capabilities presented by the subject; mixed entries. Parent or facade specs may list child-owned entry points only
  when the parent deliberately presents, routes, aggregates, or proxies that API surface.
- `Accepts`: accepted inputs, request shapes, parameters, or preconditions; mixed entries.
- `Returns`: return values, output types, response shapes, or result states; mixed entries.
- `Raises`: errors, exceptions, rejected states, or failure conditions; mixed entries.
- `Handles`: cases, events, states, branches, or conditions handled by the spec; mixed entries.
- `Tasks`: local implementation and work checklist for satisfying the subject contract; not a standalone task, adoption,
  migration, or ticket contract.
- `Done when`: completion criteria; mixed entries; no inline value.
- `Scenario`: behavioral example; inline nonempty title; mixed body entries, commonly scenario steps.
- `Example`: concrete examples, payloads, usage snippets, or expected transformations; repeatable mixed entries.

### Tasks, Scenarios, And Examples

Task markers are valid only inside `Tasks`, after exactly two spaces:

```text
[ ] open
[x] done
[X] done
[-] skipped
[!] blocked
[?] needs decision
```

- Unsupported bracketed states inside `Tasks` are invalid.
- Non-task body entries inside `Tasks` are invalid.
- Task IDs are optional, appear after the marker, start with `#`, and require one or more digits.
- Empty hash IDs such as `# blocked` are not task IDs. A task ID is not a comment.
- Task text is required and free-form after the marker and optional ID.
- Mark `[x]` only when the relevant change and checks are complete.
- Use `[!]` for blocked work and `[?]` for unresolved design decisions.

Scenario steps start after exactly two spaces with `Given`, `When`, `Then`, `And`, or `But`; the keyword must be followed
by the end of the line or whitespace. Words that merely start with these keywords are plain text. The language does not
require Given/When/Then presence or step ordering.

`Example` body entries are normal mixed entries. Multiple `Example` sections may appear in one file.

### Minimal Complete File

```sdd
Spec: Itinerary
```

## Spec Guidance

This section is guidance for writing and using specs. It does not redefine `.sdd` syntax.

- Prefer `Spec` and `Purpose` in every non-empty spec.
- Use other sections only when they add useful local authority, constraints, behavior, or context.
- Use `Purpose` for summary, concept, project role, and reader orientation. Someone looking only at `Purpose` should be
  able to infer what subject is being specified. `Purpose` may overlap lightly with other sections when that context
  supports safe discovery.
- Write `Purpose` and `Must` as outcome statements about the subject. Put temporary work instructions in `Tasks` only
  when they belong to the local subject.
- Give each behavioral rule one canonical polarity; never restate it as its logical inverse for emphasis or coverage.
  Use `Must` for a required outcome, `Must not` for an independent prohibition or non-goal, and `Forbids` for a
  disallowed dependency, path, tool, resource, or access. A `Must not` is independent only when the subject could
  satisfy every applicable `Must` and still violate it; otherwise it is redundant and must be omitted.
- Do not create specs whose subject is the task being performed by the agent, such as adoption, migration, cleanup, or
  planning, unless that task is itself a durable project workflow being specified.
- Keep negative requirements local and plausible. Add `Must not` only when it separates neighboring responsibilities,
  prevents likely misuse, preserves dependency direction, or captures a real local risk.
- Do not use specs as exhaustive lists of what the subject is not. Absence of ownership or authority is enough for
  unrelated capabilities.
- If a prohibition applies broadly, put it in the nearest shared parent or policy spec instead of repeating it in every
  child spec.
- Preserve dependency direction in `References`, `Depends on`, `Purpose`, and `Handles`. Provider, runtime, framework,
  and shared service specs describe their own contracts and direct dependencies; they must not name consumers, adapters,
  mount roots, handler implementations, or frontend clients unless the provider genuinely depends on them.
- Treat sections as semantic roles, not independent checklists. Give each contract statement one canonical home: when
  more than one section could express the same meaning, use the most specific applicable section and do not repeat it
  in broader sections; the specific entry carries the broader implication. Use a broader section only when no more
  specific section fits. The same path, symbol, or behavior may appear in multiple sections only when each occurrence
  adds a distinct section-specific meaning.
- Prefer exact paths over globs. Use a glob only when the subject contract genuinely applies to a pattern-defined
  collection or when the collection is large, variable, or generated enough that maintaining exact entries would be
  impractical. Use the narrowest pattern that fits, and never use a glob merely to avoid listing a small, stable set of
  paths. Treat a glob in `Owns` or `Can modify` as authority over every current and future non-`.sdd` match: all matches
  must share the intended ownership or edit policy, and use `**` only when recursive descendants are deliberately in
  scope.
- Use `Platform` sparingly at the root or in a major area where it adds inheritable technical context. Child specs
  inherit the nearest useful platform unless they introduce a meaningful platform shift.
- Keep `Platform` labels concise, stack-like, and slash-separated. When multiple terms are present, separate every term
  with `/`. Put the subject role, local identifier, artifact type, and behavior in `Purpose`, `Structure`, `Owns`, or
  behavioral sections instead.
- `Depends on` never overrides inherited `Forbids` or `Must not`.
- `Scenario` entries should be satisfied and checked when relevant.
- Use `Example` sparingly.
- Use comments sparingly. If a line affects required behavior, express it as `Must`, `Must not`, `Tasks`, `Scenario`, or
  `Done when` instead.
- Missing exact reference targets should be reported as unresolved references, not malformed `.sdd` syntax.
- A referenced spec is explicit context, not inherited authority. Its parent chain may be read when needed to understand
  that referenced contract, but it does not become inherited authority for the active target.

Task guidance:

- Tasks are local to the spec where they appear.
- Tasks are work guidance, not architecture overrides.
- Tasks must not contradict `Must`, `Must not`, `Forbids`, or inherited constraints.
- Parent tasks are planning context, not automatically actionable in child specs.
- Only update task status in the currently targeted spec unless instructed otherwise.
- Prefer completing one task or a small related group of tasks at a time.
- Do not complete unrelated tasks opportunistically.

## Working Procedure

Before changes:

- Identify the target file, directory, or task.
- Load the bootstrap files in order.
- Walk upward from the target path and collect relevant governing specs.
- Read the inherited chain from parent to child.
- Read the explicit `References` declared by the included specs when they affect the task or are needed to build context.
- Identify the nearest relevant local spec.
- For a `.sdd` target, confirm that it was selected for change and skip ownership and modification-path authorization for
  the spec file itself.
- For a bootstrap control-file target, apply the Spec Edit Authority rules instead of project-artifact authority.
- For each non-`.sdd` project artifact, identify its authoritative owning spec and determine the modification scope from
  `Owns` plus any additional `Can modify` paths, then snapshot that authority before changing anything.
- Identify the applicable `Must`, `Must not`, `Depends on`, `Forbids`, `Tasks`, `Scenario`, and `Done when` entries.

During changes:

- Prefer local changes.
- Make the smallest change satisfying the target task or behavior.
- If asked to complete a specific task, complete only that task unless additional work is required by direct
  dependencies.
- Preserve public contracts unless the spec asks to change them.
- Do not widen architecture boundaries.
- Do not add forbidden dependencies.
- Do not introduce global state unless explicitly allowed.
- Do not move responsibilities across boundaries unless specs require it.
- Do not implement non-goals.
- Do not overbuild beyond the spec.
- Add or update verification when required by scenarios, tasks, or project conventions.
- Do not modify unrelated files or complete unrelated tasks.

After changes:

- Check that the relevant scenarios are satisfied.
- Check that the applicable `Must` rules are satisfied.
- Check that no `Must not` or `Forbids` rules were violated.
- Check that the modified files are within the allowed scope.
- Check that the tests or validation steps pass when available.
- Update completed tasks only after the relevant change and verification are complete.

## Effective Spec Resolution

When asked to work on a path, mentally construct the effective spec.

Effective spec resolution is path-based. Use same-directory basename matching when it applies, but do not use other
filename similarities, symbol names, technical conventions, component names, or check names to decide which specs apply
unless a project-specific rule explicitly says to do so.

Example tree:

```text
travel-planner/
  travel-planner.sdd
  src/
    trips/
      trips.sdd
      itinerary.sdd
      itinerary.js
      itinerary.test.js
      trip-storage.sdd
      trip-storage.js
      trip-storage.test.js
    destinations/
      destinations.sdd
      destination-search.sdd
      destination-search.js
    ui/
      itinerary-view.sdd
      itinerary-view.js
```

Target inside `travel-planner/`:

```text
src/trips/itinerary.js
```

Effective context:

```text
travel-planner.sdd
src/trips/trips.sdd
src/trips/itinerary.sdd
```

Use all parent rules as active constraints and the nearest local spec for the most specific behavior and context.
Determine concrete change authority independently from the target's owning spec and the pre-operation `Owns` and
`Can modify` snapshot.

## Tool Context Discovery

Tools and agents that build context for a path should use the same path-based resolution model as humans.

By default, include:

- Bootstrap files in load order.
- Directory-level specs from the selected content root to the target directory, ordered root to target.
- Ancestor specs from the selected content root to the target path.
- The same-directory basename spec for the target file when it exists.
- Explicit `References` declared by the included specs.

Do not include sibling specs, nearby files, or same-named files by default, except for same-directory basename spec
matches. Include other files only when they are explicitly referenced, requested, or selected by a project-specific
rule.

When following explicit paths for related-spec relevance, follow paths from:

- `Structure`
- `Owns`
- `Can modify`
- `Can read`
- `References`
- `Depends on`

Do not follow paths from `Forbids` or `Exposes` for relevance expansion, although generic reference indexes may still
extract and index paths from those sections.

When a relevance resolver follows an exact path:

- A linked `.sdd` file resolves to that spec.
- A linked ordinary file resolves to its same-basename `.sdd` spec when present.
- A linked directory resolves to directory-level specs for that directory only.

Non-glob directory links such as `./` or `../shared` must not recursively include every descendant `.sdd` file.
Recursive descendant inclusion requires an explicit glob such as `./**` or `./**/*.sdd`.

Deduplicate resolved specs by normalized path relative to the selected content root. Protect recursive expansion against
cycles and expose or document any depth limit used for soft-link expansion.

When a tool reports context, it should identify why each file was included. Useful reasons include:

```text
bootstrap
project override
local override
directory context
ancestor spec
nearest local spec
explicit reference
requested nearby file
```

Context discovery must not expand ownership or modification permission. Referenced or nearby files remain read context
unless the active spec owns them or grants additional permission through `Can modify`. A `Can modify` grant never
replaces the target's owning spec or its constraints.

## Report And Compliance Check

Before final response, check:

- Did you read the bootstrap files?
- Did you resolve the spec chain?
- Would removing an added or materially edited entry leave implementation, authority, observable behavior, dependency
  boundaries, necessary local orientation, and verification materially unchanged? If so, remove it. Apply this check
  to untouched entries only when full-spec review or cleanup is in scope.
- Does every negative rule prevent a plausible local mistake rather than state an obvious or unrelated exclusion?
- Was every changed `.sdd` file selected by the Operator's request, an active SpecDD workflow, or an authorized task,
  without relying on `Owns` or `Can modify` authorization?
- Does every changed spec avoid `.sdd` paths in `Owns` or `Can modify`, including directory or glob entries intended to
  authorize spec changes?
- Is every glob necessary, the narrowest practical pattern, and valid for every current and future match?
- Does every code symbol and externally meaningful code contract use an `@` symbol reference, including within prose?
- Is every `@` symbol reference treated the same inside and outside inline code spans, with backticks used only for
  their normal code-formatting role?
- Are exact literal values and inline code expressions backticked, with each span limited to the smallest relevant
  fragment rather than ordinary prose or an entire entry?
- For non-`.sdd` project artifacts, did every change, including creation, preserve ownership and match the pre-operation
  authority snapshot or the same-operation exception defined above and explicitly authorized by the Operator?
- Did you satisfy the relevant `Must` rules?
- Did you avoid violating the applicable `Must not` and `Forbids` rules?
- Did you run or explain verification?

When reporting completed work, include:

- Specs used.
- Files changed.
- Verification run, or why verification was not run.
- Any SpecDD uncertainty, skipped check, or remaining risk.

## Conflict Handling

If specs conflict:

- Apply the more restrictive rule only when the constraints are compatible and one safely narrows the other.
- Prefer explicit local behavior only when it does not violate parent constraints.
- Treat a rule that requires behavior forbidden by another active rule, including a required dependency named by
  `Forbids`, as an unsatisfiable conflict. Do not choose the negative or positive rule as the winner.
- Treat competing ownership claims as an authority conflict; do not resolve them by proximity or restrictiveness.
- Treat the inherited architectural constraints as active unless explicitly and safely narrowed.
- Do not use a task as justification to violate a rule.
- If a safe partial change is possible, do the safe subset.
- If the change cannot proceed safely, mark the task `[?]` or `[!]` and explain the issue.

## Compactness Rules

Specs should stay small.

Prefer concise, direct requirements. Example fragment:

```sdd
Must:
  Trip storage writes require validated itinerary input.
```

Avoid:

- Long prose.
- Duplicating parent rules unnecessarily.
- Mirroring the same rule across `Must`, `Must not`, `Forbids`, `Scenario`, or `Done when` when one section already
  states the requirement.
- Task-shaped `Purpose` or `Must` entries such as "implement", "add", "update", "migrate", or "adopt" when the intended
  contract is the resulting behavior or state.
- Specs that describe the current assignment instead of the subject that will remain after the assignment is complete.
- Far-field exclusions that would be equally true for almost any subject, such as an itinerary spec saying it must not
  set hotel room temperature.
- Long `Must not` lists that inventory unrelated directories, technologies, or behaviors instead of naming the nearest
  meaningful boundary.
- Directory specs that aggregate detailed behavior from individual files, artifacts, components, workflows, operations,
  or services instead of delegating to same-basename specs.
- Parent specs that list nested descendant inventory instead of immediate child roles.
- Vague structure labels that remove useful local meaning, such as "items", "things", or "services", when the child role
  is known.
- Provider, runtime, platform, shared workflow, or infrastructure specs that describe their consumers instead of their
  own boundary.
- `Platform` entries that mix stack labels with subject role or behavior.
- Explaining obvious implementation details.
- Turning specs into project tickets.
- Large exhaustive documents.
- Vague tasks.
- Broad refactor instructions.

## Minimal Valuable Spec

```sdd
Spec: Itinerary

Purpose:
  Keep a trip itinerary organized by day.

Owns:
  ./itinerary.js
  ./itinerary.test.js

Must:
  When the place name and date are present, an itinerary item exists.
  Itinerary items remain grouped by trip day.
  Itinerary items appear in chronological order.

Must not:
  Manage destination search results.

Forbids:
  @localStorage

Done when:
  All scenarios have tests.

Scenario: missing place name
  Given the place name is empty
  When the person adds the itinerary item
  Then validation fails
  And no itinerary item is stored
```

## Comprehensive Syntax Example (Not A Template)

This example demonstrates available sections in one place and is intentionally larger than a typical spec. Omit every
section and entry that does not pass the Relevance Gate.

```sdd
# Comments are allowed as whole lines and do not create requirements.

Spec: Itinerary

Platform: TypeScript/Browser

Purpose:
  Keep Travel Planner itineraries organized by trip day.

Structure:
  ./itinerary.ts: Itinerary behavior
  ./itinerary.test.ts: Itinerary tests
  ./fixtures: Test fixtures owned by their local spec

Owns:
  ./itinerary.ts
  ./itinerary.test.ts
  @Itinerary
  @ItineraryResult

Can modify:
  ./fixtures/*.json: Variable itinerary fixture collection

Can read:
  ../support/storage-failure-samples.json: Diagnostic examples for storage normalization

References:
  ../models/itinerary-item.sdd
  ../ports/trip-storage.sdd
  ../errors/itinerary-error.sdd

Must:
  A missing place name is rejected before storage.
  Itinerary items have stable IDs.
  Existing itinerary items are preserved when a new place is added.
  Storage failures are normalized before return.

Must not:
  Manage destination search results.

Forbids:
  @localStorage
  ../ui/*

Depends on:
  @TripRepository
  @TripStoragePort
  @TripLogger

Exposes:
  @Itinerary.addPlace
  @Itinerary.movePlace

Accepts:
  @NewItineraryItemInput
  place name
  trip date

Returns:
  @ItineraryResult
  created itinerary item ID
  itinerary grouped by day

Raises:
  @MissingPlaceNameError
  @TripStorageError
  @ItineraryItemNotFoundError

Handles:
  missing place name
  missing trip date
  storage write failure
  duplicate itinerary item ID

Tasks:
  [x] #0 Define the itinerary public contract.
  [ ] #1 Add validation for a missing place name.
  [ ] #2 Preserve itinerary order after moving a place.
  [?] #3 Confirm whether the same place can be added more than once.

Done when:
  All scenarios have tests.

Scenario: missing place name
  Given the place name is empty
  When the person adds the itinerary item
  Then validation fails
  And no itinerary item is stored

Scenario: storage failure
  Given the place name and trip date are valid
  And trip storage fails
  When the person adds the itinerary item
  Then a @TripStorageError is returned
  And the existing itinerary is unchanged

Example:
  input place: `Louvre Museum`
  input date: `2026-06-12`
  result itinerary item count: `1`
```

## Prime Directive

When working in a SpecDD project:

- Read the bootstrap files.
- Read the relevant specs.
- Resolve inherited constraints.
- Work only within local authority.
- Make the smallest correct change.
- Do not violate `Must not` or `Forbids`.
- Use `Tasks` to guide work.
- Use `Scenario` to guide behavior and checks.
- Keep specs and changed assets aligned.

Specs are the project's durable prompt. Follow them.
