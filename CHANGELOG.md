## v0.6.0 - (2026-08-21)

### Added

- Generated Dockerfiles renamed to the conventional `Dockerfile`
  (production) and `Dockerfile.local` (self-contained local image). The
  local image is self-initializing (`mix setup && mix phx.server` on
  start), accepts `--build-arg MIX_ENV`, runs `mix assets.setup`
  explicitly, and no longer installs the `phx_new` archive; asset steps
  are omitted on `--no-assets` projects in both Dockerfiles.
- `workbench_igniter` Elixir package (`igniter/`): all project configuration
  is now applied semantically (AST-based) via `mix workbench.setup` and one
  `mix workbench.install.*` task per feature, with a 93-test suite.
- `wb.sh`: thin Docker wrapper replacing `app.sh`. New `add FEATURE`
  command to install features on an existing project.
- `WORKSPACE_PATH` (config.conf): projects are generated into a workspace
  directory (default `./_workspace`); the workbench stays permanently in
  its own directory and is mounted read-only at `/app/workbench`.
- Conditional `workbench_dep/0` injected in the generated `mix.exs`: the
  project stays self-contained when the workbench is not mounted.
- Each workspace owns its `docker-compose.yml`, baked with real values
  (name, ports, images) at creation — the source of truth of its
  orchestration. Host ports are auto-assigned (first available from 4000 /
  5050) so several workspaces run simultaneously without conflicts, and
  there is no ports configuration in `config.conf` anymore. The workspace
  services form a **pod**: a minimal `network` holder service owns the
  namespace and the published ports (the role of the "pause" container in
  a Kubernetes pod) and `app`, `database` and `pgadmin` join it — they all
  reach each other through `localhost`, so the project keeps Phoenix's
  default database configuration untouched and the database is not
  published to the host. The images are born with the identity of the
  launching HOST user (`ARG UID/GID` baked at build — they are always
  built locally): everything written into the workspace belongs to them,
  never to root, with no runtime `user:` configuration anywhere. The app image is project-owned (`<app>:local`, buildable from its
  own `Dockerfile.local`); the workbench seeds it as a zero-cost alias
  (`docker tag`) of the shared toolchain image `workbench:<elixir>-<otp>`. pgAdmin is fully self-contained (inline
  `configs.content` servers.json and entrypoint-generated pgpass). The
  workspace compose builds from the project-owned `Dockerfile.local`;
  switching to the production `Dockerfile` is a manual edit of the compose
  file. The workbench tooling (`Dockerfile.app`, `entrypoint.sh`) never
  leaves the workbench. The `setup` and `documentation` container runs no
  longer publish the application port.
- Generated `.env.sample`: same template as `.env` with the secret blanked
  out, meant to be committed (`cp .env.sample .env` flow). The generated
  README was expanded: table of contents, environment variables reference
  (deployment/required/default per variable, including the standard
  Phoenix release variables), asdf/mise setup from `.tool-versions`,
  Docker Compose start/stop instructions and, on `--exdoc` projects, a
  documentation section covering `mix docs`, `doc/` and `llms.txt`.
- `mix cover` now generates a structured markdown report instead of a
  terminal dump: coverage table per file with anchor links into the
  excoveralls HTML report and a totals row, ExUnit run metadata (seed,
  max_cases, timings), a totals summary table, one section per test
  module with per-test rows linking to the source line on GitHub
  (derived from the ExDoc `source_url` config, degrading to plain text),
  failure detail blocks, and skipped-test handling. The report is
  written to `TESTING.md` at the project root (gitignored; a placeholder
  keeps `mix docs` working before the first run) and the runner became a
  `mix coveralls.html` subprocess whose exit code participates in the
  validation. `coveralls.json` widens `file_column_width` to 128 so the
  parsed rows keep full file paths, and the generated `homepage_url` now
  reuses `repo_url` instead of inventing a domain.
- Generated outputs moved to the standard directories: the excoveralls
  HTML report goes to `cover/` and the ExDoc output to `doc/` (the
  defaults, already covered by phx.new's stock `.gitignore` and
  `.dockerignore` — so they neither pollute the repo nor ship in the
  production image, which used to copy `priv/static/doc` via `priv/`).
  `assets/` now holds only source files (the report template lives in
  `assets/cover/template/`), `Plug.Static` and the ExDoc controller
  serve `doc/` relative to the VM cwd (dev-only routes), and the test
  dummy pages are planted in plain `doc/` instead of `_build/test`. The
  gitignored `TESTING.md` entry is added via a shared
  `WorkbenchIgniter.gitignore_entry/3` helper.
- Coverage report template (`_style.html.eex`): added the unprefixed
  `border-radius`, `box-shadow` and `transition` properties (only the
  long-dead `-webkit-`/`-moz-` prefixed forms were present, so modern
  browsers rendered the report without those styles) and removed a stray
  quote inside the `#menu` rule.

### Removed

- `app.sh` and the whole sed/seed approach it implemented: `seeds/` (moved
  to `igniter/priv` as EEx templates and assets), `scripts/contexts/`
  (replaced by direct generation of the final schemas), the legacy `scripts/entrypoint.sh`
  (rewritten for the igniter flow), root `assets/` and `pgadmin/`
  (moved to `igniter/priv/assets` and setup templates), the
  `CUSTOM_SCHEMAS` configuration, the `*_CONTAINER_NAME` settings, and the
  generated `priv/repo/pgadmin/` credential files.

### Fixed

- Latent issues inherited from `app.sh`, corrected in the igniter port:
  healthcheck OpenAPI schema written over `user.ex`, `datbase.dbs` typo,
  helper tests coupled to Auth0, `mix db` failing on fresh projects,
  Finch pool missing on `--no-mailer` projects, Hex lock conflicts
  after feature installs, duplicated migration timestamps when composing
  auth0+openai, the database healthcheck passing the password as the
  database name (`pg_isready -d`), the application healthcheck always
  failing because `curl` was missing from the dev image, and flaky Hex
  fetches during image builds (`HEX_HTTP_CONCURRENCY=1`).
- Generated README no longer embeds the `.env` content — it used to leak
  the generated `SECRET_KEY_BASE` into a committable file; it now points
  to `.env.sample`. The env export instruction became
  `set -a && source .env && set +a` (the previous
  `export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs)` broke on values with spaces), and
  `.env` starts with `PHX_HOST="localhost"` instead of a placeholder
  domain that failed WebSocket origin checks locally.
- Markdown tables in the generated README were broken: EEx `:trim` leaves
  stray newlines around block tags, splitting conditional table rows with
  blank lines. Conditional rows are now rendered inline and `plant/5`
  collapses residual blank-line runs.

## Unreleased

> During development, milestones can be added to this section. Once finished working on them, it's only needed to copy the commented title template line, adjust the title version & date and uncomment it.
<!-- ## v0.0.0 - (0000-00-00) -->
### Added

<!-- # BETTER SERVICE STRUCTURE -->
- remove dev dockerfile even devinvoriment. the image must be compiled in prod, its very dangerous to have dev images with doc and source code in circulation, de docs coverage, monitoring must be run only in local

- ajustar parche en config.dev "localhost"

<!-- # CONTINUE -->
- Configuration file documentation.
- **Remove workbench** command in workbench script.
  - adjust docker-compose to work independently from script
- Workbench script implementation: **Stripe**.
- Workbench script implementation: **GraphQL**.
- Generated all missing documentation for functions in `app` script.

### Fixed

- DB port change breaks pgadmin maybe back?

## v0.4.2 - (2025-11-09)

### Added

## v0.4.1 - (2025-08-10)

### Added

- Project configuration completed with `mix release` generation files and suggested `.dockerignore` file.

- The sections in **Testing Reports** were reordered.

### Fixed

- ExDoc unlocked from version `0.35` due error on **DomLoaded event listening**.
