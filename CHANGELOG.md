## v0.8.0 - (2026-08-24)

### Added

- New `new2` command: the vanilla project creation. It generates a stock
  `phx.new` project and applies only what the dockerized workspace
  requires to boot it — the dev endpoint bound to `0.0.0.0` (the compose
  pod pattern delivers the published port on the namespace interface,
  never on loopback), the `.env`/`.env.sample` pair the compose
  `env_file` declaration requires, and the `.env` entry in `.gitignore`.
  The application and feature settings in `config.conf` are ignored, so
  no base config, no `README.md`/`CHANGELOG.md`/`.tool-versions` and no
  feature installer: they are added afterwards with `add`. It is driven
  by the new `mix workbench.setup2` task (6 options, `composes: []`),
  and is the base for the ongoing restructuring of the igniter package.
- New `clustering` cartridge (`./wb.sh add clustering`): boots the
  production release as a named distributed node so DNSCluster can
  connect the replicas. `phx.new` already ships the `:dns_cluster`
  dependency, its supervision-tree child and the `DNS_CLUSTER_QUERY`
  read in `config/runtime.exs`; what it leaves open is the release
  running in distributed mode, which the cartridge writes into
  `rel/env.sh.eex` along with the other three `mix release.init`
  templates — generated from the running Elixir rather than copied into
  this repo — and `DNS_CLUSTER_QUERY` in the environment files. Nothing
  to cluster with inside a single-container workspace: it prepares the
  project for a multi-replica deployment.

- New `scaled` deployment (`up --deploy scaled`): production replicas of
  the release image, baked from `scripts/docker-compose.scaled.seed.yml`.
  It drops the pod pattern on purpose — replicas sharing a network
  namespace would share one IP and one port, so only the first would
  bind the server and every `RELEASE_NODE` would collide — and puts the
  replicas on a bridge network with one host port each and a shared
  `app` network alias, which makes Docker's DNS answer that single name
  with every address. Leaving the pod means the database is reached by
  name, so `DATABASE_URL` is overridden and a one-shot `migrate` service
  runs before the replicas start.
  With the `clustering` feature installed the replicas also form a real
  BEAM cluster, since that alias is what `DNSCluster` queries. Without it
  they run isolated — a valid deployment for a stateless application — so
  `up` and `build` warn and carry on rather than refusing, and the compose
  leaves `DNS_CLUSTER_QUERY` unset, keeping `DNSCluster` out of the
  supervision tree instead of letting it poll for peers a short-named
  release could never reach.
- The scaled deployment puts an nginx balancer in front of the replicas
  (single entry point, WebSocket upgrade for LiveView and Channels, and
  an `X-Served-By` header carrying the address of the replica that
  answered — the same address its node name shows). The per-replica
  ports stay published so a specific node can still be addressed.
  `up` and `build` take `--replicas N` (default 4) and `--no-balancer`;
  both only shape how the compose file is baked, so `logs`, `ps`, `stop`
  and `down` never need them. New `NGINX_IMAGE_VERSION` in `config.conf`.

### Updated

- `new2` no longer runs `mix release.init`. Its four `rel/*.eex` files
  are customization scaffolding whose defaults Mix already carries built
  in, and they now belong to the clustering cartridge. `new` keeps
  running it from the entrypoint, unchanged.
- Deployments are selected with `--deploy`, not `--env`: `up`, `build`,
  `logs`, `ps`, `stop`, `down`, `iex` and `bash` pick a compose file, not
  an environment, and the third value (`scaled`) is a topology rather than
  a `MIX_ENV`. The old spelling is rejected with a message pointing at the
  new one instead of being silently accepted. `setup` and `demo` keep
  `--env`, where the value really is `MIX_ENV`.
- `up` and `down` pass `--remove-orphans`. Every deployment of a
  workspace shares one compose project but not the same services — dev
  has `app`, the scaled one has `app1..N` plus `balancer` and `migrate`, and
  `--replicas`/`--no-balancer` change that set between runs — so the
  containers of the previous shape used to stay up, unmanaged and
  invisible to `ps`. `stop` and `ps` do not accept the flag.
- `new` and `new2` share their body in the `create_project` function,
  and the template planting, the `SECRET_KEY_BASE` generation and the
  new `env_entry/3` (the `.env`/`.env.sample` counterpart of
  `gitignore_entry/3`, so a cartridge owns its own variables) live in
  `WorkbenchIgniter`.
- The `.env` template no longer carries `DATABASE_URL`, `ECTO_IPV6` and
  `POOL_SIZE` in projects generated with `--no-ecto`.
- `DNS_CLUSTER_QUERY`, `RELEASE_DISTRIBUTION` and `RELEASE_NODE` left the
  `workbench.setup` `.env` template, where they sat commented out. The
  clustering cartridge owns them now, each where it belongs: the query in
  `.env`/`.env.sample`, the release pair in `rel/env.sh.eex`.

## v0.7.0 - (2026-08-23)

### Fixed

- Igniter features planted their files under module-derived directories
  (`Macro.underscore/1`), which diverge from the phx.new app-name
  directories when the app name carries digits (app `:lorem_3` →
  `Lorem3Web` → `lib/lorem3_web/` instead of `lib/lorem_3_web/`),
  forking a parallel source tree with duplicated modules whose tests
  mask each other. Every feature now derives `web_dir`/`app_dir` from
  the app name, exactly like phx.new.

### Added

- Igniter cartridges now hold only code: every non-code file — EEx
  templates, verbatim assets, binaries — moved from
  `lib/workbench_igniter/features/<f>/{templates,assets}/` to
  `priv/features/<f>/`, where nothing is compiled, so Elixir assets drop
  the `.asset` suffix (`cover.ex.asset` → `cover.ex`). `embed_templates`/
  `embed_assets` resolve the cartridge's `priv/features/<name>/`
  directory automatically.
- Coverage report themes for the coveralls feature: the excoveralls HTML
  template is now picked from
  `priv/features/coveralls/assets/template/<theme>/` in the igniter
  cartridge, selected with `mix workbench.install.coveralls --theme` (or
  `COVERAGE_THEME` in `config.conf`, forwarded by `workbench.setup
  --coverage-theme`). `custom` keeps the original report; the new
  `exdoc-ish` theme (default) mimics the ExDoc pages (sidebar with project logo and
  tabs, search-style file filter, light/dark synced with ExDoc's own
  setting, Lato and Remixicon reused from `doc/dist/`, coverage vs.
  minimum target cards, lines covered / missed / line hits stats).
- `mix cover`: a failing module is flagged with a leading ❌ in its
  `TESTING.md` heading, so broken modules stand out in the ExDoc sidebar
  (passing modules stay unmarked).
- `mix cover`: `COVERAGE.md` and `TESTING.md` merged into a single
  `TESTING.md` ("Test Suite Report"): execution result board, then the
  coverage section, then the per-module sections. The report links
  (overview and per file) point at the `/dev/docs/cover` route instead
  of `excoveralls.html`, and the report page moved to
  `/dev/docs/testing.html`.

- `wb.sh` lifecycle commands over the workspace compose, Makefile-style:
  `logs [SERVICE...]` (follow, Ctrl+C detaches), `stop`, `down` and `ps`.
- `build [-e, --env ENV] [OPTIONS]` command: (re)builds the workspace's
  app image without deploying it — the dev image from the project-owned
  `Dockerfile.local` (previously only `new` built it, destructively), or
  the production release image with `-e prod`. Extra OPTIONS go to
  `docker compose build` (e.g. `--no-cache`). The production compose
  baking moved into a `bake_prod_compose` function, shared by `build`
  and `up --env prod`.
- `wb.sh` session commands running on the **already running** app
  container via `docker compose exec` (instant, and exiting never stops
  the application): `iex` (IEx shell), `bash`, and `mix [ARGS...]` for
  any mix task (`cover`, `docs`, `test`...). With the system down, `mix`
  falls back to a one-off container, starting the database dependency.

### Updated

- `igniter/` is now the restructured cartridge edition: the legacy
  package and the first cartridge edition (`igniter2/`) were removed, and
  with a single edition left the `IGNITER_DIR` override is gone too.
  - Every cartridge is a directory with its own `README.md` — the
    dep-only ones (credo, mock, exdebug, psql_extras, osmon, githooks,
    exmachina, stripe) split into `<feature>.ex` + `task.ex` like the
    rest; the "single-file cartridge" format is gone.
  - One test file per cartridge: the parameterized `deps_test.exs`
    became `credo_test.exs`, `mock_test.exs`, etc.
  - `priv/assets/` disappeared: the DbSchema diagrams and Postman
    collections are text, so they moved into the enhancements cartridge
    (`assets/{db_schema,postman}/`, embedded like any other asset); the
    setup templates moved to `priv/setup/templates/`. `priv/features/`
    mirrors the cartridges for binary assets only (the exdoc logo).
    `WorkbenchIgniter.asset/1` was removed; cartridges reach `priv/` with
    the local `priv_asset/1` / `plant_binary_asset/3`, derived from the
    cartridge directory name.
- `up` now deploys **detached** (both dev and prod): the terminal stays
  free, and the command prints the application URL plus the `logs`/`stop`
  hints. Previously it followed the containers in the foreground and
  Ctrl+C stopped them.
- `demo` follows the logs between `up` and `delete`: the demo blocks
  while the application is tried out, and Ctrl+C moves on to the
  teardown (a no-op SIGINT trap keeps the script alive through the
  Ctrl+C that detaches the log follower).

### Removed

- `run` command (and its entrypoint branch): it was a workaround to run
  `iex` and mix tasks, superseded by the `iex`/`mix`/`bash` exec
  commands. Its blocking "Press any key" prompt is gone with it.
- `prune` command: it stopped ALL containers on the host and ran
  `docker system prune -a --volumes` — a machine-wide blast radius out
  of the workbench's scope. Workspace cleanup is covered by `delete`
  (`down --volumes --rmi local`) and the new `stop`/`down`.

### Fixed

- The generated `mix cover` task broke the production image build: it
  read `coveralls.json` at compile time (`File.read!` in a module
  attribute) and the production Dockerfile never copies that file. It
  now falls back to defaults when the file is absent — harmless, since
  releases carry no Mix and the task cannot run in them — and declares
  `@external_resource`, so editing `coveralls.json` recompiles the task
  (before, a changed `minimum_coverage` was silently ignored until a
  forced recompile). Fixed in both igniter editions and documented here
  because the asset ships into every generated project.
- Misleading guidance removed: comments in `wb.sh` and the compose seed
  suggested switching the workspace's `docker-compose.yml` to the
  production Dockerfile by hand. That breaks every toolchain command
  (`setup`, `add`, `mix`, `iex` run through the same app service) — the
  production deployment has its own `docker-compose.prod.yml`, baked by
  `up --env prod`. The entrypoint now also fails with a clear message
  when it lands in a mix-less production image instead of a cryptic
  "mix: command not found".
- `workbench.setup` (cartridge edition) now re-resolves the dependency
  lock — `deps.unlock --all` + `deps.get`, queued ahead of every feature
  task — instead of leaving the known phx.new-lock conflict (idna 7.x vs
  the `auth0_jwks`→hackney chain needing ~> 6.1) to the entrypoint's
  after-setup fallback. Igniter's automatic post-apply fetch tolerates
  that resolution failure, but the queued binary-asset task runs `mix`
  in the project and aborted setup on the unresolved deps, so auth0
  projects failed to generate. The moved medicine also fixes standalone
  `mix workbench.setup` runs without the workbench script.
- Binary assets are no longer routed through the igniter rewrite
  pipeline, which normalizes every file it writes
  (`String.trim_trailing/1` plus a final newline) and corrupts binaries
  — the planted ExDoc logo carried an appended byte, and a binary
  ending in whitespace-like bytes would have been truncated. The
  cartridge edition now plants them verbatim: a new internal
  `mix workbench.plant_asset` task copies the file byte-for-byte, and
  installers compose it via `WorkbenchIgniter.plant_binary_asset/4`
  (an `Igniter.add_task/3` after-apply step, so dry-run semantics stay
  intact). The legacy edition keeps the old behavior: it is on its way
  out once the cartridge edition proves itself.
- Internal container ports are no longer magic numbers: the `:4000` in
  the host-port parser and the `:5050` anchors now reference
  `APP_INTERNAL_PORT` / the new `PGADMIN_INTERNAL_PORT`, and the compose
  seed takes pgAdmin's listen port as a `%{pgadmin_internal_port}`
  placeholder.

## v0.6.0 - (2026-08-21)

### Added

- Generated Dockerfiles renamed to the conventional `Dockerfile`
  (production) and `Dockerfile.local` (self-contained local image). The
  local image is self-initializing (`mix setup && mix phx.server` on
  start), accepts `--build-arg MIX_ENV`, runs `mix assets.setup`
  explicitly, and no longer installs the `phx_new` archive; asset steps
  are omitted on `--no-assets` projects in both Dockerfiles.
- `workbench_igniter` Elixir package (`igniter/`): all project configuration
  is now applied semantically (AST-based) via `mix workbench.setup` and one
  `mix workbench.install.*` task per feature, with a 93-test suite.
- `wb.sh`: thin Docker wrapper replacing `app.sh`. New `add FEATURE`
  command to install features on an existing project.
- `WORKSPACE_PATH` (config.conf): projects are generated into a workspace
  directory (default `./_workspace`); the workbench stays permanently in
  its own directory and is mounted read-only at `/app/workbench`.
- Conditional `workbench_dep/0` injected in the generated `mix.exs`: the
  project stays self-contained when the workbench is not mounted.
- Each workspace owns its `docker-compose.yml`, baked with real values
  (name, ports, images) at creation — the source of truth of its
  orchestration. Host ports are auto-assigned (first available from 4000 /
  5050) so several workspaces run simultaneously without conflicts, and
  there is no ports configuration in `config.conf` anymore. The workspace
  services form a **pod**: a minimal `network` holder service owns the
  namespace and the published ports (the role of the "pause" container in
  a Kubernetes pod) and `app`, `database` and `pgadmin` join it — they all
  reach each other through `localhost`, so the project keeps Phoenix's
  default database configuration untouched and the database is not
  published to the host. The images are born with the identity of the
  launching HOST user (`ARG UID/GID` baked at build — they are always
  built locally): everything written into the workspace belongs to them,
  never to root, with no runtime `user:` configuration anywhere. The app image is project-owned (`<app>:local`, buildable from its
  own `Dockerfile.local`); the workbench seeds it as a zero-cost alias
  (`docker tag`) of the shared toolchain image `workbench:<elixir>-<otp>`. pgAdmin is fully self-contained (inline
  `configs.content` servers.json and entrypoint-generated pgpass). The
  workspace compose builds from the project-owned `Dockerfile.local`;
  switching to the production `Dockerfile` is a manual edit of the compose
  file. The workbench tooling (`Dockerfile.app`, `entrypoint.sh`) never
  leaves the workbench. The `setup` and `documentation` container runs no
  longer publish the application port.
- Generated `.env.sample`: same template as `.env` with the secret blanked
  out, meant to be committed (`cp .env.sample .env` flow). The generated
  README was expanded: table of contents, environment variables reference
  (deployment/required/default per variable, including the standard
  Phoenix release variables), asdf/mise setup from `.tool-versions`,
  Docker Compose start/stop instructions and, on `--exdoc` projects, a
  documentation section covering `mix docs`, `doc/` and `llms.txt`.
- `mix cover` now generates a structured markdown report instead of a
  terminal dump: coverage table per file with anchor links into the
  excoveralls HTML report and a totals row, ExUnit run metadata (seed,
  max_cases, timings), a totals summary table, one section per test
  module with per-test rows linking to the source line on GitHub
  (derived from the ExDoc `source_url` config, degrading to plain text),
  failure detail blocks, and skipped-test handling. The report is
  written to `TESTING.md` at the project root (gitignored; a placeholder
  keeps `mix docs` working before the first run) and the runner became a
  `mix coveralls.html` subprocess whose exit code participates in the
  validation. `coveralls.json` widens `file_column_width` to 128 so the
  parsed rows keep full file paths, and the generated `homepage_url` now
  reuses `repo_url` instead of inventing a domain.
- Generated outputs moved to the standard directories: the excoveralls
  HTML report goes to `cover/` and the ExDoc output to `doc/` (the
  defaults, already covered by phx.new's stock `.gitignore` and
  `.dockerignore` — so they neither pollute the repo nor ship in the
  production image, which used to copy `priv/static/doc` via `priv/`).
  `assets/` now holds only source files (the report template lives in
  `assets/cover/template/`), `Plug.Static` and the ExDoc controller
  serve `doc/` relative to the VM cwd (dev-only routes), and the test
  dummy pages are planted in plain `doc/` instead of `_build/test`. The
  gitignored `TESTING.md` entry is added via a shared
  `WorkbenchIgniter.gitignore_entry/3` helper.
- Coverage report template (`_style.html.eex`): added the unprefixed
  `border-radius`, `box-shadow` and `transition` properties (only the
  long-dead `-webkit-`/`-moz-` prefixed forms were present, so modern
  browsers rendered the report without those styles) and removed a stray
  quote inside the `#menu` rule.

### Removed

- `app.sh` and the whole sed/seed approach it implemented: `seeds/` (moved
  to `igniter/priv` as EEx templates and assets), `scripts/contexts/`
  (replaced by direct generation of the final schemas), the legacy `scripts/entrypoint.sh`
  (rewritten for the igniter flow), root `assets/` and `pgadmin/`
  (moved to `igniter/priv/assets` and setup templates), the
  `CUSTOM_SCHEMAS` configuration, the `*_CONTAINER_NAME` settings, and the
  generated `priv/repo/pgadmin/` credential files.

### Fixed

- Latent issues inherited from `app.sh`, corrected in the igniter port:
  healthcheck OpenAPI schema written over `user.ex`, `datbase.dbs` typo,
  helper tests coupled to Auth0, `mix db` failing on fresh projects,
  Finch pool missing on `--no-mailer` projects, Hex lock conflicts
  after feature installs, duplicated migration timestamps when composing
  auth0+openai, the database healthcheck passing the password as the
  database name (`pg_isready -d`), the application healthcheck always
  failing because `curl` was missing from the dev image, and flaky Hex
  fetches during image builds (`HEX_HTTP_CONCURRENCY=1`).
- Generated README no longer embeds the `.env` content — it used to leak
  the generated `SECRET_KEY_BASE` into a committable file; it now points
  to `.env.sample`. The env export instruction became
  `set -a && source .env && set +a` (the previous
  `export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs)` broke on values with spaces), and
  `.env` starts with `PHX_HOST="localhost"` instead of a placeholder
  domain that failed WebSocket origin checks locally.
- Markdown tables in the generated README were broken: EEx `:trim` leaves
  stray newlines around block tags, splitting conditional table rows with
  blank lines. Conditional rows are now rendered inline and `plant/5`
  collapses residual blank-line runs.
