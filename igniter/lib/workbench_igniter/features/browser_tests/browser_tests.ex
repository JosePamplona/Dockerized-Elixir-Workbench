  Tests that drive the application through a real browser: the browser
  as a service of the workspace, and in the project the tests that use
  it.

  Pending: a manifest only — the need is written (`NEED.md`) and the
  README says what the box is expected to bring, but nothing is
  designed and the installer is not written, so the catalog shows the
  box as pending and nothing can insert it. When it is done, fill this
  directory in like any other cartridge (see the checklist in the
  package README), its `DESIGN.md` first.
